# Flask Web Application

This is a simple Flask web application that renders a form. Below are the instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd flask-webapp
   ```
3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
flask run
```

Make sure to set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `app`:
- On Windows:
  ```
  set FLASK_APP=app
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  export FLASK_APP=app
  ```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the form.
